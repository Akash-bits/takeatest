Question 1: Consider a uniform rod of mass M=4m and length l pivoted about its centre. A mass m moving with velocity v making angle &theta = pi/4 to the rodâ€™s long axis collides with one
end of the rod and sticks to it. The angular speed of the rod - mass system just after the collision is:
Options:
  (a) 4v/7l (b) (3&#8730;(2)*v)/(7l)
  (c) 3*v/(7l)
  (d) (3*v)/7&#8730;(2)*l
